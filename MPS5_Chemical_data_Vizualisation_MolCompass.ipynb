Haloperidol is indicated for the treatment of the manifestations of several psychotic disorders including schizophrenia, acute psychosis, Tourette syndrome, and other severe behavioural states.[F4645] It is also used off-label for the management of chorea associated with Huntington\\'s disease and for the treatment of intractable hiccups as it is a potent antiemetic. Dopamine-antagonizing medications such as haloperidol are though to improve psychotic symptoms and states that are caused by an over-production of dopamine, such as schizophrenia, which is theorized to be caused by a hyperdopaminergic state within the limbic system of the brain.[A34360]\\r\\n\\r\\nUse of the first-generation antipsychotics (including haloperidol) is considered highly effective for the management of the \"\"positive\"\" symptoms of schizophrenia including hallucinations, hearing voices, aggression/hostility, disorganized speech, and psychomotor agitation. However, this class of drugs is also limited by the development of movement disorders induced by dopamine-blockade such as drug-induced parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia, tardive dyskinesia, as well as other side effects including sedation, weight gain, and prolactin changes. While there are limited high-quality studies comparing haloperidol to lower-potency first-generation antipsychotics such as [DB00477], [DB01624], [DB00623], and [DB01403], haloperidol typically demonstrates the least amount of side effects within this class, but demonstrates a stronger disposition for causing extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS).[A180613, A180616, A180625] These other low‐potency antipsychotics are limited by their lower affinity for dopamine receptors, which requires a higher dose to effectively treat symptoms of schizophrenia. In addition, they block many receptors other than the primary target (dopamine receptors), such as cholinergic or histaminergic receptors, resulting in a higher incidence of side effects such as sedation, weight gain, and hypotension.\\r\\n\\r\\nInterestingly, in vivo pharmacogenetic studies have demonstrated that the metabolism of haloperidol may be modulated by genetically determined polymorphic _CYP2D6_ activity. However, these findings contradict the findings from studies in vitro with human liver microsomes and from drug interaction studies in vivo. Inter-ethnic and pharmacogenetic differences in haloperidol metabolism may possibly explain these observations.[A32346]\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst-generation antipsychotic drugs have largely been replaced with second- and third-generation (atypical) antipsychotics such as [DB00734], [DB00334], [DB00363], [DB01224], [DB01238], and [DB00246]. However, haloperidol use remains widespread and is considered the benchmark for comparison in trials of the newer generation antipsychotics.[A180625]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe efficacy of haloperidol was first established in controlled trials in the 1960s.[A180610]\"|CHEMBL54|OC1(CCN(CCCC(=O)C2=CC=C(F)C=C2)CC1)C1=CC=C(Cl)C=C1\\nasenapine|Developed by Schering-Plough after its merger with Organon International, asenapine is a sublingually administered, atypical antipsychotic for treatment of schizophrenia and acute mania associated with bipolar disorder.

It has the histamine-antagonist properties of the antihistamines together with central nervous system effects resembling those of chlorpromazine. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p604)|CHEMBL1764|COC1=CC2=C(SC3=C(C=CC=C3)N2C[C@H](C)CN(C)C)C=C1\\namoxapine|Amoxapine, the <i>N</i>-demethylated derivative of the antipsychotic agent loxapine, is a dibenzoxazepine-derivative tricyclic antidepressant (TCA). TCAs are structurally similar to phenothiazines. They contain a tricyclic ring system with an alkyl amine substituent on the central ring. In non-depressed individuals, amoxapine does not affect mood or arousal, but may cause sedation. In depressed individuals, amoxapine exerts a positive effect on mood. TCAs are potent inhibitors of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. In addition, TCAs down-regulate cerebral cortical &beta;-adrenergic receptors and sensitize post-synaptic serotonergic receptors with chronic use. The antidepressant effects of TCAs are thought to be due to an overall increase in serotonergic neurotransmission. TCAs also block histamine H<sub>1</sub> receptors, &alpha;<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptors and muscarinic receptors, which accounts for their sedative, hypotensive and anticholinergic effects (e.g. blurred vision, dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention), respectively. See toxicity section below for a complete listing of side effects. Amoxapine may be used to treat neurotic and reactive depressive disorders, endogenous and psychotic depression, and mixed symptoms of depression and anxiety or agitation.|CHEMBL1113|ClC1=CC2=C(OC3=CC=CC=C3N=C2N2CCNCC2)C=C1\\nalizapride|Alizapride is a dopamine antagonist that is capable of demonstrating both prokinetic and antiemetic effects. This kind of pharmacological activity makes it effective for use in the treatment of various kinds of nausea and vomiting, including that which may occur postoperatively.|CHEMBL290194|COC1=CC2=NNN=C2C=C1C(=O)NCC1CCCN1CC=C\\nnortriptyline|Nortriptyline hydrochloride, the active metabolite of [amitriptyline], is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA).[L11878] It is used in the treatment of major depression and is also used off-label for chronic pain and other conditions.[L11881]|CHEMBL445|CNCCC=C1C2=CC=CC=C2CCC2=CC=CC=C12\\nmianserin|A tetracyclic compound with antidepressant effects. Mianserin was previously available internationally, however in most markets it has been phased out in favour of [mirtazapine].|CHEMBL6437|CN1CCN2C(C1)C1=CC=CC=C1CC1=CC=CC=C21\\nperospirone|Perospirone is an atypical or second-generation antipsychotic of the azapirone family that antagonizes serotonin 5HT2A receptors and dopamine D2 receptors. It also displays affinity towards 5HT1A receptors as a partial agonist. Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma developed perospirone in Japan in 2001 for the treatment of acute schizophrenia and bipolar mania as well as chronic schizophrenia. It is commonly present as the hydrated hydrochloride salt form. Classified as a neuroleptic agent, perospirone is shown to be effective against positive, negative and general symptoms in patients with schizophrenia [A19676]. It is also shown to be less associated with extrapyramidal symptoms as a side effect compared to [DB00502].|CHEMBL1472975|[H][C@@]12CCCC[C@]1([H])C(=O)N(CCCCN1CCN(CC1)C1=NSC3=CC=CC=C13)C2=O\\nblonanserin|Blonanserin is an atypical antipsychotic approved in Japan in January, 2008. It offers improved tolerability as it lacks side effects such as extrapyramidal symptoms, excessive sedation, or hypotension. As a second-generation (atypical) antipsychotic, it is significantly more efficacious in the treatment of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia compared to first-generation (typical) antipsychotics.|CHEMBL178803|CCN1CCN(CC1)C1=NC2=C(CCCCCC2)C(=C1)C1=CC=C(F)C=C1\\nzotepine|Zotepine, with the formula (2-chloro-11-(2-dimethyl-amino-ethoxy)-dibenzo thiepin, is a neuroleptic drug. It was designed and synthesized by Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co Ltd.[A31855] It has been used as an antipsychotic in Japan, India and some places in Europe like UK and Germany since 1980\\'s.[A31857] Zotepine was never approved by the FDA. In 1993, it was classified as inactive drug substance (Status I, Type II) and in 1995 the FDA studied the manufacturing procedures of Zotepine tablets in Germany, but the status remained inactive.[L1082] When the analysis of antipsychotics was retaken in 2016 by the FDA, zotepine did not reach the threshold effect to be further studied.[L1313]. In the EMA, by 2015 it was under pharmacovigilance studies for the potential treatment of acute renal failure.[L1314]|CHEMBL285802|CN(C)CCOC1=CC2=CC=CC=C2SC2=CC=C(Cl)C=C12\\nmelperone|Melperone is an atypical antipsychotic of the butyrophenone chemical class, making it structurally related to the typical antipsychotic haloperidol.  Melperone has been used for a span of greater than 30 years in the European Union [L1316]. It has been well established in the treatment of confusion, anxiety, restlessness (particularly in the elderly) and schizophrenia as It is known to be well-tolerated with an excellent safety profile. Recently, it has been studied as a treatment of psychosis related to Parkinson\\'s disease [L1316].|CHEMBL1531134|CC1CCN(CCCC(=O)C2=CC=C(F)C=C2)CC1\\n\"\"\""
